# Robotic-Process-Automation
This project automates the process of updating a supplier system using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with UiPath. The automation includes uploading a supplier list, adding company logos, and updating the system with supplier information. The goal is to streamline and optimize repetitive tasks, reducing the time spent on manual updates.
